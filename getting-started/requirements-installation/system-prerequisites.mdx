# System Requirements

Ensure your environment and tools meet the following system requirements to successfully build, run, and explore the BTree project.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

- **Linux OS**: The BTree implementation is designed specifically for Linux environments. It leverages Linux system calls and relies on toolchains common on Linux platforms.

> This focus ensures maximum compatibility with x86_64 assembly, GCC, and NASM assembler behaviors on Linux.

---

## 2. Hardware Architecture

- **x86_64 CPU architecture**: The assembly source code (`btree.asm`) targets 64-bit x86 platforms.

> The implementation uses specific CPU registers and calling conventions consistent with the System V AMD64 ABI used on Linux.

---

## 3. Required Development Tools

### Netwide Assembler (NASM)
- Used to assemble the `.asm` files within the project.
- Must support 64-bit output compatible with GCC linking.

### GCC Compiler
- Compiles the C source files, including the demo and supporting utilities.
- Links assembled object code and builds the final binaries/shared libraries.
- Supports `-march=x86-64` and related options for 64-bit builds.

### make Utility
- Automates the build process, running compilation and linking according to provided Makefiles and build scripts.

### Text Editor
- Any capable text editor or IDE suitable for editing C and Assembly code.

---

## 4. Runtime Tools

- **Standard Linux command line environment**
- Shell (`bash` or compatible) to run build scripts such as `btree_make.sh` and demo scripts like `go_btest.sh`.

---

## 5. Libraries and Dependencies

- No external libraries beyond standard C library and Linux system libraries are required.
- The BTree library is self-contained, but does interface to standard libc functions such as `calloc`, `free`, `memset`, and `printf`.

---

## 6. Network and Permissions

- No specific network connectivity is required.
- Permissions needed to compile and run code, including executing scripts and creating files.

---

## 7. Tool Purpose and Workflow

| Tool             | Purpose                              | Role in Workflow                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| NASM             | Assembles `.asm` source             | Produces object files from Assembly code            |
| GCC              | Compiles and links C code           | Builds demo executable and shared libraries          |
| make             | Build automation                    | Runs compilation/linking targets reliably            |
| Shell            | Script execution and command input | Executes build and run scripts                        |
| Text Editor      | Source code editing                 | Modify and customize code and parameters              |

---

## 8. Practical Tips

- Make sure NASM is installed and accessible in your path for assembling `.asm` files.
- Verify GCC version supports 64-bit compilation (`gcc --version`).
- Use the provided `btree_make.sh` script as it orchestrates building all components in order.
- Confirm execution permissions on shell scripts (`chmod +x ./btree_make.sh` and `chmod +x ./go_btest.sh`).
- Ensure your Linux user has the rights to create files and run processes in the workspace.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

- **NASM not found**: Install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install nasm`.
- **GCC missing or outdated**: Install/upgrade with `sudo apt install gcc` or `gcc-<version>`.
- **make command not found**: Install with `sudo apt install make`.
- **Permission denied running scripts**: Adjust with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.
- **Build failures**: Check that all dependencies as above are installed, and that NASM and GCC commands in the Makefiles are correct for your platform.

---

For a smooth start, confirm your system meets all these requirements before proceeding to installation and running the demo.

## Example: Verify Tool Availability

In your terminal, check the availability of required tools:

```bash
nasm -v       # Should output NASM version
gcc --version # Should show GCC version
make --version # Should print make utility version
```
