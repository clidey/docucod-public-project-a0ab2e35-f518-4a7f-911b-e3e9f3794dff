# Installation Instructions for Building the BTree Shared Library and Demo

Welcome to the installation guide for the BTree project. This page provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough to build the BTree shared library and compile its demo program using the provided scripts and makefiles. By following these instructions, you will have a working library and demo to test on your Linux system.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Linux OS (x86_64 architecture)
- **Tools Installed:**
  - NASM assembler (Netwide Assembler)
  - GCC compiler
  - `make` utility
- **Access:** Command line access with permissions to build and execute scripts

If any tools are missing, install them first via your Linux distribution's package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install nasm gcc make` on Debian-based systems.

---

## 2. Overview of Build Components

The BTree project includes three main components that need to be built in the following order:

1. **Utility Library (`libutil.so`)** - Provides support routines.
2. **BTree Shared Library (`libbtree.so`)** - The core BTree code, combining assembly and C implementations.
3. **Demo Program (`btest`)** - A C program that exercises the BTree library.

The provided shell script `btree_make.sh` automates building all these components in sequence through their respective makefiles.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Download and Prepare the Project

- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the BTree project (usually named `BTree-main`).
- Make sure the script `btree_make.sh` and the subfolders `util/`, `btree/`, and `btest/` are present.

### Step 2: Run the Build Script

Execute the build script to compile all components:

```bash
sh ./btree_make.sh
```

**What happens in this script:**

- Clears the terminal.
- Changes directory to `util/`, cleans, and rebuilds the utilities library.
- Verifies `libutil.so` exists.
- Changes directory to `btree/`, cleans, and rebuilds the BTree shared library.
- Confirms `libbtree.so` was created.
- Changes directory to `btest/`, cleans and compiles the demo program.
- Sets execution permissions for the demo runner script.
- Prints a success message: “alls well that ends well.”

### Step 3: Verify Successful Build

If the build completes without errors, the following files should be present:

- `util/libutil.so`
- `btree/libbtree.so`
- `btest/btest` executable

If any step fails, review the error messages (common issues are missing dependencies or permissions).

<Note>
If the build halts unexpectedly, ensure NASM, GCC, and make are installed and in your system PATH. Also check you have execute permissions for the script.
</Note>

---

## 4. Understanding the Makefiles

Each component has its own makefile:

### a) Util Makefile (`util/makefile` - referenced but not detailed here)
- Builds the utility shared library `libutil.so`.

### b) BTree Makefile (`btree/makefile`):

Key rules:

- **`libbtree.so`** depends on `btree_asm.o` and `btree.o`.
- **`btree_asm.o`** compiled from `btree.asm` using NASM with ELF64 format.
- **`btree.o`** compiled from `btree.c` with GCC as position-independent code (`-fPIC`).

The final shared library is linked with `-shared` and security option `-z noexecstack` to prevent executable stack.

### c) Demo Makefile (`btest/makefile`):

Key rules:

- Compiles `main.c` into `main.o` with pthread support.
- Links `main.o` with `libbtree.so` and `libutil.so` to create the `btest` executable.

---

## 5. Running the Demo Program

After successful build, proceed as follows:

1. Navigate to the `btest/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd btest
   ```

2. Run the provided launcher script:
   ```bash
   ./go_btest.sh
   ```

3. The demo will execute with a randomly generated seed, running insertions and optional deletions (controlled by demo parameters).

4. Demo output is saved to `out.txt`. You will be prompted to view it using a pager:

    - Type `Y` or press Enter to view.
    - Type `N` to exit.

<Check>
If you make changes to demo parameters (see the `Configuring the Demo Program` page), rerun the build script before executing the demo.
</Check>

---

## 6. Customizing Build or Debugging

- **Modifying Demo Behavior:** Edit defines in `btest/main.h`:
  - `DATA_COUNT` controls number of insertions
  - `DELETE_COUNT` controls number of deletions

  After changes, rerun `sh ../btree_make.sh` from the `BTree-main` root or execute the build script again.

- **Verbose Compilation:** You can manually run make commands to inspect output:

```bash
cd util && make clean && make
cd ../btree && make clean && make
cd ../btest && make clean && make
```

- **Troubleshooting:** If compilation fails:
  - Verify tools installed and on your PATH.
  - Confirm correct NASM version (supporting ELF64).
  - Check for file permission issues.
  - Review error output for missing headers or libraries.

## 7. Summary

By following this guide, you have:

- Built the utility and BTree shared libraries
- Compiled the demo program linked against these libraries
- Learned how to run the demo and inspect its output
- Understood how the build process maps to source components

Next, explore the [Configuring the Demo Program](/getting-started/configuration-first-run/demo-configuration) page to tailor the demo to your needs.

### Full Command Summary

```bash
cd BTree-main
sh ./btree_make.sh   # Build all components
cd btest
./go_btest.sh        # Run the demo program
```

<Tip>
Keep your environment clean by running `make clean` in each directory if you want to rebuild from scratch.
