# Key Features & Capabilities

Discover the core strengths of the BTree Project's implementation, designed to empower Linux developers with a blending of blazing-fast Assembly internals and seamless C interoperability. This page concisely summarizes the essential features that make this BTree implementation a compelling choice for performance-critical applications.

## Seamless C Interoperability with Assembly Performance

At its heart, this BTree is a finely tuned shared library implemented in 64-bit Assembly language. Despite the low-level optimization, the entire system exposes a clean, user-friendly C interface accessible to any C developer on Linux.

- **Direct C API:** The BTree functions are easily callable from standard C code, allowing integration without complexity.
- **Callback Flexibility:** Users supply their own comparison, key extraction, deletion, and traversal callbacks in C, offering full control over the stored object behavior.
- **Shared Library Design:** Distributed as a `.so` shared library, enabling effortless linking and dynamic usage in diverse projects.

Imagine writing your own data structures and simply providing the logic to compare and handle your objects — the BTree manages the intricate balancing and storage efficiently in the background.


## Efficient Assembly Internals for Speed-Critical Applications

The entire BTree algorithm runs in highly optimized x86_64 Assembly, tuned for maximum speed:

- **Core Tree Operations:** Insert, remove, search, and traversal are implemented with careful memory management and minimal overhead.
- **Internal Node Management:** Operations such as node splitting, filling, merging, and key borrowing from siblings ensure the BTree remains balanced with minimal latency.
- **Memory Operations:** Leveraging `memmove64` and tailored internal mechanisms to maximize data movement efficiency.

Through this design, developers achieve the speed of native Assembly code while maintaining the usability and flexibility of C. It's ideal for applications where data indexing and retrieval times make a critical difference.


## Demo Program Included for Hands-On Exploration

Alongside the core library, the project provides a comprehensive demo program demonstrating typical BTree usage:

- **Configurable Dataset:** Easily adjust parameters like `DATA_COUNT` and `DELETE_COUNT` to test various insertion and deletion scenarios.
- **Randomized Data:** The demo generates unique numeric keys and associated string data, showcasing the BTree's handling of arbitrary datasets.
- **Stepwise Operations:** Outputs clear logs during insertions, deletions, tree walking, and search validations.

This serves as both a learning tool and a testbed — you can modify the demo's parameters and callbacks to reflect your data structures and logic without delving into Assembly.


## Customizable Callbacks for Object Management

The BTree's design puts you in control, letting you define how objects are handled:

- **Object Comparison Callback (`o_cmp_cb`):** Determines ordering between objects for insertion.
- **Key Comparison Callback (`k_cmp_cb`):** Enables efficient searching based on keys extracted from objects.
- **Object Deletion Callback (`o_del_cb`):** Hook to perform cleanup or logging when an object is removed.
- **Key Extraction Callback (`k_get_cb`):** Extracts the key from an object to enable BTree operations.

These callbacks allow the BTree to be data-agnostic and adaptable to your specific needs, whether your objects are simple numeric values or complex structures.


## Robust Core Operations Exposed

The shared library exposes a suite of core operations encapsulated behind simple function calls:

- **Initialization & Termination:** Prepare new trees with customizable minimum degree and object sizes, and cleanly tear down trees releasing all allocated memory.
- **Insertion:** Add new objects while automatically managing node splits to keep tree balance.
- **Removal:** Delete objects by key with full support for complex underflow cases through merging and borrowing strategies.
- **Search:** Locate objects by key with optional buffered result copying.
- **Traversal:** Walk the entire tree invoking your callback on each object.

Each function works in harmony with the internal Assembly logic to deliver consistent, predictable performance.


## Real-World Example: Using the Demo's Data Structure

Consider the bundled demo data type, which stores a double precision floating-point number and a formatted string representation. By defining how to compare these objects and extract keys (the floating-point value), the demo illustrates the full lifecycle of insertions and deletions with live output.

This scenario mimics practical uses where numeric indices and formatted labels need to be stored and retrieved quickly.


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always implement reliable comparison callbacks to ensure proper data ordering and search accuracy.
- When modifying the demo or integrating into your project, adjust the `mindeg` parameter to balance node size vs. depth, based on your expected dataset size and lookup patterns.
- Use the deletion callback to properly manage resources if your stored objects include dynamically allocated elements.
- Run the demo with various `DATA_COUNT` and `DELETE_COUNT` values to understand insertion and removal impacts.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Incorrect Comparison Logic:** May lead to failed insertions or improper tree structure. Ensure callbacks strictly follow three-way comparison semantics (-1, 0, +1).
- **Memory Leaks:** Implement the deletion callback carefully to free resources attached to objects.
- **Demo Build Failures:** Confirm you have NASM, GCC, and Make installed and that you're operating on a Linux x86_64 system.


## Sample Function Call Snippet

```c
// Initialize BTree with minimum degree, object size, and callbacks
b_tree_t *tree = b_tree_alloc();
b_tree_init(tree, 15, sizeof(data_t), o_cmp_cb, k_cmp_cb, o_del_cb, k_get_cb);

// Insert an object
data_t myData = {123.456, "123.456"};
b_insert(tree, &myData);

// Search the tree
data_t result;
if (b_search(tree->root, &(myData.d), &result) != NULL) {
    // Found object
    printf("Found: %s\n", result.s);
}

// Delete the object
b_remove(tree, &(myData.d));

// Terminate tree
b_tree_term(tree);
b_tree_free(tree);
```
