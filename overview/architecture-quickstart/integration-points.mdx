# Integration & Extensibility Overview

Explore how the BTree library is designed for seamless integration into your own projects and extensibility to fit specific needs. This overview explains the shared library architecture, the C interface exposed for easy embedding, and approaches to extend or customize the BTree implementation.

---

## Designed for Integration: The Shared Library Model

At its core, the BTree implementation is compiled into a shared library (`libbtree.so`) that encapsulates high-performance x86_64 assembly logic with a clean C interface. This modular design provides several key integration benefits:

- **Language Agnostic Access via C Interface:** The shared library exposes all essential functions through C-compatible symbols, enabling usage from C and other languages with C foreign function interfaces.
- **Binary Compatibility:** Precompiled shared objects allow easy linking into projects without requiring users to build the assembly source themselves.
- **Code Encapsulation:** The assembly internals are hidden behind the shared library boundary, reducing risk and complexity for integrating applications.
- **Concurrent and Thread-Friendly:** The runtime supports multithreaded applications, as demonstrated by the included demo.

### How the Shared Library Works

The shared library bundles assembly routines with a C API, making key BTree operations available via function calls, such as:

- `b_tree_init()` — Initialize the BTree structure with user callbacks
- `b_insert()` / `b_remove()` — Insert and remove keys
- `b_search()` — Lookup keys efficiently
- `b_tree_term()` — Cleanup and free all allocated structures

All callbacks for comparison, key extraction, and deletion are provided by the user, maximizing integration flexibility.

## Embedding the BTree Library in Your Application

### Step 1: Include the C Header

The primary interface is defined in the header `btree/btree.h`. Here you will find all function declarations, type definitions, and callback prototypes necessary to interact with the BTree.

```c
#include "btree/btree.h"
```

### Step 2: Link Against the Shared Library

Compile your C or C-compatible source code linking against `libbtree.so` as shown:

```bash
gcc -march=x86-64 -m64 -Wall your_app.c -L/path/to/lib -lbtree -o your_app
```

For projects using the provided makefiles and build scripts, the linkage is automated.

### Step 3: Provide Required Callbacks to Customize Behavior

- **Object Comparison (`o_cmp_cb`)** – function to compare two objects stored in the tree.
- **Key Comparison (`k_cmp_cb`)** – function to compare a key with an object.
- **Delete Callback (`o_del_cb`)** – function called to clean up objects when removed.
- **Get Key Callback (`k_get_cb`)** – function to extract key from an object.

These let you tailor the BTree to your specific data and ordering requirements.

## Extensibility Options

While the core BTree is implemented in minimal and highly optimized assembly, extensibility can be achieved through:

### 1. Custom Callbacks

Your application provides behavior-specific logic via callbacks passed during `b_tree_init()`. This design allows:

- Custom key types and comparison logic
- Specialized deletion procedures such as freeing associated resources
- Iteration and walking through tree elements with custom visitor functions

### 2. Demo Code as a Reference for Extension

The demo program (`btest/main.c` and `btest/main.h`) showcases practical usage examples, including:

- How to allocate, initialize, and free the tree
- How to insert, search, and delete elements
- Working with user-defined data structures wrapped in the tree

You can use these as templates to extend or embed the BTree in your own applications.

### 3. Modifying and Rebuilding

As the source code is open under the GPLv2+ license, you can modify the assembly and C sources to add new methods or adjust internal policies. The build system with makefiles and shell scripts simplifies rebuilding the library from source.

## Example: Integrate & Use BTree in Your Project

```c
#include "btree/btree.h"
#include <stdio.h>

// Define comparison callback
int cmp_obj(const void* a, const void* b) {
  // Implement your object-object comparison logic
}

int cmp_key(const void* key, const void* obj) {
  // Implement your key-object comparison logic
}

void del_obj(const void* obj) {
  // Clean up resources associated with obj
}

const void* get_key(const void* obj) {
  // Return key pointer from object
}

int main() {
  b_tree_t *tree = b_tree_alloc();
  if (!tree) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to allocate BTree\n");
    return 1;
  }

  b_tree_init(tree, 15 /* mindeg */, sizeof(MyObject), cmp_obj, cmp_key, del_obj, get_key);

  // Insert, delete, search as needed

  b_tree_term(tree);
  b_tree_free(tree);

  return 0;
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Callback Safety:** Ensure all callbacks are thread-safe if your application is multithreaded.
- **Memory Management:** Manage memory carefully; the library expects you to provide cleanup callbacks.
- **Library Updates:** If modifying assembly internals, thoroughly test for correctness and performance impacts.
- **Demo Reference:** Consult `btest/main.c` for a working example and to understand thread interactions.
