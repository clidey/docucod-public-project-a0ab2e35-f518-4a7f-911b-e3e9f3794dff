# Integrating BTree into Your Project

This guide provides concrete, actionable steps for integrating the BTree shared library into your own C projects. You will learn how to configure your build environment, link the BTree shared library, incorporate its headers, and properly utilize BTree’s core features through the C interface. Whether you are building a small utility or embedding a high-performance BTree in a complex system, these instructions will help you get started confidently and avoid common pitfalls.

---

## 1. Overview

### What You Will Achieve
- Link the `libbtree.so` shared library into your C projects.
- Include and configure the BTree headers for seamless compilation.
- Use the core BTree API functions to initialize, insert, search, delete, traverse, and terminate your BTree instance.

### Prerequisites
- Linux OS on x86_64 architecture (compatible with the BTree build).
- The BTree shared library (`libbtree.so`) built and available locally. See [Building & Running the Demo](/overview/architecture-quickstart/quickstart-demo) for build instructions.
- Basic familiarity with compiling and linking C programs.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this guide, you'll be able to embed the BTree library in your own C project, linking dynamically against the shared library, invoking key BTree operations, and handling callbacks for customized object management.

### Time Estimate
10–20 minutes depending on your familiarity with C build tools and linking dynamic libraries.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate - ideal for C developers integrating third-party libraries.

## 2. Step-by-Step Integration Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare BTree Shared Library

Ensure you have successfully built the BTree shared library `libbtree.so`. This is done by running the provided build script from the root folder:

```bash
sh ./btree_make.sh
```

This script builds the utility, the BTree shared library, and the demo program.

<Tip>
If the `libbtree.so` file is not found after the build, verify your environment, make sure NASM and GCC are installed, and that you have the correct permissions.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Include BTree Headers in Your C Source

Your C files should include the BTree public interface header located under `btree/btree.h`. For example:

```c
#include "btree/btree.h"
```

If you use utility functions, include `util/util.h` as needed.

<Tip>
Maintain the correct relative paths or configure your compiler's include paths to locate headers properly with `-I` flags.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Link Against the Shared Library in Your Build

When compiling your C project, link against `libbtree.so`. Assuming the library is located at `../btree/libbtree.so`, your `gcc` command should look like this:

```bash
gcc -march=x86-64 -m64 -z noexecstack your_source.o ../btree/libbtree.so -o your_program
```

If your project also depends on the `libutil.so` library (used in many demos), include it as well:

```bash
gcc -march=x86-64 -m64 -z noexecstack your_source.o ../btree/libbtree.so ../util/libutil.so -o your_program
```

Ensure `libbtree.so` is in your runtime library path (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) or installed in a standard location.

### Step 4: Initialize the BTree Instance

Before using the BTree, allocate and initialize a `b_tree_t` tree structure with:

```c
b_tree_t *tree = b_tree_alloc();
b_tree_init(tree, mindeg, object_size, o_cmp_cb, k_cmp_cb, o_del_cb, k_get_cb);
```

- `mindeg` is the minimum degree of the tree (controls node sizes).
- `object_size` is the size of each stored object.
- Callback functions (`o_cmp_cb`, `k_cmp_cb`, `o_del_cb`, `k_get_cb`) customize object comparison, key comparison, deletion callback, and key retrieval.

Refer to the demo source (`btest/main.c`) for example implementations.

### Step 5: Use Core Operations

- **Insert objects:**

  ```c
  b_insert(tree, object_ptr);
  ```

- **Search for keys:**

  ```c
  void *result = b_search(tree->root, key_ptr, buffer);
  if (result != NULL) {
      // found
  }
  ```

- **Remove objects by key:**

  ```c
  b_remove(tree, key_ptr);
  ```

- **Traverse the tree:**

  ```c
  b_walk(tree, walk_callback);
  ```

- **Terminate and free tree:**

  ```c
  b_tree_term(tree);
  b_tree_free(tree);
  ```

### Step 6: Compile and Run

Compile your program incorporating all dependencies and run it:

```bash
gcc -march=x86-64 -m64 -z noexecstack main.o ../btree/libbtree.so ../util/libutil.so -o my_btree_app
./my_btree_app
```

<Tip>
Ensure the callbacks you provide for comparison and deletion are consistent with your stored object structure.
</Tip>

## 3. Practical Example: Minimal Integration

Here is a minimal example illustrating integration in your C source:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "btree/btree.h"

// Define your data structure
typedef struct {
    int key;
} my_data_t;

// Callback functions
int object_compare(void const *a, void const *b) {
    my_data_t const *d1 = a;
    my_data_t const *d2 = b;
    return (d1->key > d2->key) - (d1->key < d2->key);
}

int key_compare(void const *key, void const *obj) {
    int k = *(int const *)key;
    my_data_t const *d = obj;
    return (k > d->key) - (k < d->key);
}

void delete_callback(void const *obj) {
    // Optional cleanup - none needed here
}

void const * get_key(void const *obj) {
    my_data_t const *d = obj;
    return &d->key;
}

void walk_callback(void const *obj) {
    my_data_t const *d = obj;
    printf("Key: %d\n", d->key);
}

int main() {
    size_t mindeg = 3;
    b_tree_t *tree = b_tree_alloc();
    b_tree_init(tree, mindeg, sizeof(my_data_t), object_compare, key_compare, delete_callback, get_key);

    my_data_t d1 = {10};
    my_data_t d2 = {20};
    b_insert(tree, &d1);
    b_insert(tree, &d2);

    printf("Walk tree after insertions:\n");
    b_walk(tree, walk_callback);

    int key = 10;
    my_data_t buffer = {0};
    if (b_search(tree->root, &key, &buffer)) {
        printf("Found key %d in tree.\n", buffer.key);
    }

    b_remove(tree, &key);
    printf("Walk tree after deletion of key 10:\n");
    b_walk(tree, walk_callback);

    b_tree_term(tree);
    b_tree_free(tree);

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Integration Tips & Best Practices

- **Callback Implementation:**
  - Ensure your comparison callbacks properly reflect the sorting logic for your object and keys.
  - Your deletion callback should free or release any resources associated with stored objects.

- **Shared Library Linking:**
  - To avoid runtime linking errors, ensure `libbtree.so` is discoverable via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or installed into system library locations.
  - Use compiler flags to explicitly specify library paths: `-L/path/to/lib -lbtree`.

- **Thread Safety:**
  - The current implementation itself does not provide built-in thread safety; ensure your own synchronization if accessing the tree concurrently.

- **Memory Management:**
  - Use `b_tree_alloc` and `b_tree_free` to manage the tree structure memory.
  - Always pair `b_tree_init` with `b_tree_term` before freeing to avoid leaks.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Pay attention to return values (e.g., `b_search` returns NULL if key not found).
  - Check parameters thoroughly before use.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Challenges">
<Accordion title="Shared Library Not Found at Runtime">
Make sure your environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes the directory of `libbtree.so`. For example:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../btree:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Alternatively, use `ldconfig` to register the library system-wide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors for Missing Headers">
Verify your compiler include path contains the directory holding `btree.h` and any utility headers. Use `-I` flags to add them, e.g.: `gcc -I../btree -I../util ...`
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Callback Behavior">
Make sure your comparison and key retrieval callbacks match the data stored. Inconsistent callback logic can lead to incorrect tree behavior or data corruption.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Memory Leaks or Crashes on Termination">
Always call `b_tree_term` before freeing the tree pointer to ensure all nodes and objects are properly released.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
